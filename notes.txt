=============

    -> Python 

        -> Full Stack : Django (Python for Apps, Flask, FAST API etc)

        -> Data Analytics / Data Science / AI (Numpy, Pandas, Pytorch etc)

        -> Cloud & DevOps (OS, Sys, Cloud SDK's etc)

    -> Core Python which is common for all above courses (30-35 Days)

        -> Language Fundamentals 

    ->  Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
        Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability 
        with the use of significant indentation. 
        Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.

    -> High-level programming language

        -> Human Understandable language (English) 

        -> python (English) 

    -> Low-level programming languages

        -> Machine Understandable language (01010101) [Binary Language]

        -> 01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110 

    -> General-purpose programming language

        -> If i can do multiple type of tasks / apps 

        -> python (we can build various types of applications)

            -> Desktop Applications 

            -> Web Applications 

            -> Data Oriented Applications

            -> etc 

    -> Domain Specific programming languages

        -> If i can do only one specific type of tasks / apps 

        -> SQL Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language 
            used to manage data.

    -> Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability 
        with the use of significant indentation

        -> Readability is good because of indentation

        -> Indentation 

            -> other languages => () ; etc 
            -> python language => space

        -> Readability & Indentation

            -> Java 
            
                class Main {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {  
                        int first = 10;
                        int second = 20;
                        int sum = first + second;
                        System.out.println(sum);
                    }
                }

            -> Python 

                first = 10
                second = 20
                sum = first + second
                print(sum)

    -> Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.

        -> Dynamically type-checked language (python)

            -> Data Types : Categorization of data 

                -> text, whole numbers, decimal numbers etc 

            -> In Dynamically type-checked language we don't need to define data types 

                -> product = "Apple Iphone 15"
                -> price = 50000
                -> quantity_left = 5
                -> rating = 4.6

        -> Static type-checked language (java)

            -> In Static type-checked language we need to define data types for sure

                -> String product = "Apple Iphone 15";
                -> double price = 50000;
                -> int quantityLeft = 5;
                -> double rating = 4.6;

    -> Garbage-collected

        -> Removing Unused Data 

        -> Python automatically cleans up the unused data / memory 

            -> print(product)
            -> print(price)
            -> print(rating)

            -> python cleans up quantity_left as it's not used
