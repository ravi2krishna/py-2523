=============    

    -> Python rules 

        -> Comments are represented using # 

            -> when we comment using #, python will ignore that line

        -> When working with numerics (1,2,3.5 etc) we can directly use them in print()

        -> When working with text, in python text is called as "strings"

            -> Rule is strings need to be enclosed in 'good morning' or "good morning"

        -> print() : prints on standard output 

        -> id() : will show memory address 

    -> Memory Model Of Python (Variables)

        -> If the value is already present, python will not create again a memory block, 
            instead it will just use reference, so memory is efficiently used 

        -> Simple Data Type : Holds one value in a single variable ex is int  

        -> Complex Data Type : Holds "multiple values" in a single variable ex is list 

    -> type() : will display the data type of variable

    -> Interpolation 

        -> Interpolation technique replaces, place holders with actual values dynamically

        -> Using f-strings (Formatted String Literals)

                    -> x = 10 
                    -> x = x + 5 (long form)
                    -> x += 5 (short form)
                    -> x *= 5 (short form)

                    -> Increment / Decrement : ++ / --

                        -> Python doesn't support above syntax 

                        -> In python to achieve Increment / Decrement we use

                    -> and : if both the conditions are True, then result is True 
                    -> or : if one of the conditions is True, then result is True 
                    -> not : negates, if true then false and vice versa

                            X       Y       X and Y    X or Y    not X    not Y

        -> Numeric Type 

            -> int : 1,2,4,0,-1,-5 etc
            -> float : 3.5, 10.0, 2.1 etc 
            -> complex : 
                -> a + ib in math (i is imaginary)
                -> a + bj in python 

        -> Text Type 

            -> str : String is a sequence of characters inclosed in " " or ' '

        -> Boolean Type

            -> bool : Represents True/False 
        
        -> None Type 

            -> NoneType : Represents nothing i.e absence of value 

        -> Sequence Type 

            -> String is also a sequence type 

            -> List : Complex Datatype => Holds Multiple Values, represented using [], Mutable (can be changed)

            -> Tuple : Complex Datatype => Holds Multiple Values, represented using (), Immutable (cannot be changed)

        -> Type Casting is NOT SAFE, data loss might occur 

        -> We use some predefined Functions 

27th Oct 2025
=============

    -> Control Structures / Control Statements

        -> Control structures helps you determine the flow of execution in a program, 
            allowing you to make decisions and repeat tasks.

        -> Python has given three types of Control structures

            -> Conditional Statements / Structures (Decision Making Statements)

            -> Looping Statements / Structures (Iteration Statements)

            -> Branching Statements / Structures (Jumping Statements)

        -> Indentation 

            -> Indentation in Python is a fundamental and mandatory aspect of its "syntax", 
                used to define the structure and hierarchy of code blocks. 
                Unlike many other programming languages that use curly braces or keywords 
                to delineate blocks, Python relies entirely on consistent indentation.

            -> Using space correctly 

                -> Python allows for any consistent number of spaces or a single tab(4 spaces) for indentation, 
                the widely accepted and recommended standard.

                -> At least one space but recommended is 4 space i.e tab 

                
        -> Conditional statements

            -> Used to run a "block of code" based on a condition result

                    -> syntax 
                        if condition:
                            statements 

            
            -> if else

                -> runs a block of code, if the condition is True 
                   runs another block of code, if the condition is False  

                    -> syntax 
                        if condition:
                            statements 
                        else:
                            statements
                        
        -> NOTE : input() function reads input from user 

28th Oct 2025
=============
    
    -> The ternary operator in Python, also known as a conditional expression, 
    provides a concise way to write an if-else statement on a single line. 
    It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values 
    based on whether the condition is true or false.

    -> syntax 
        value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
    
    -> elif ladder

        -> elif is a keyword that stands for "else if". 
        It is used in conditional statements to check for "multiple conditions" 
        sequentially after an initial if statement.

        -> syntax 
            if condition:

        -> Offers a more expressive and readable alternative to 
            complex if-elif-else chains

        -> introduced from python 3.X 

        -> In other languages like java / c++ we had (switch case)

        -> syntax

                case pattern1:
                    # Code block 1

=============

    -> Looping Statements (Iteration Statements)

        -> Loops in Python are used to repeatedly execute a block of code. 
        
        -> When you want to do a task multiple times, use loops

        -> Python offers two primary types of loops
            
            -> "while" loops 

            -> "for" loops

        -> while loop 

            -> while loops execute a block of code repeatedly 
            as long as a specified condition remains True

            -> We use while generally, when we don't know number of
            Iterations in advance 

            -> syntax

                while condition:
                    statements
                
        -> for loop

            -> for loops are used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) 
            or other iterable objects. 
            The loop executes a block of code once for each item in the sequence. 

            -> We use for generally, when we  know number of Iterations in advance 

            -> syntax 

                for var in sequence:
                    print(var)
            
            -> How do i know, if an object is iterable ?

                -> use dir() 
                -> dir() function in Python is a built-in function used for introspection, 
                    allowing you to discover the attributes and methods of an object 

            -> range() 

                -> The range() function in Python generates an immutable sequence of numbers. 
                It is commonly used for iterating a specific number of times in for loops. 

                -> range(start, stop, step): This form generates a sequence of numbers starting 
                from start (inclusive) up to, but not including, the stop value, 
                with an increment of step. The step can be positive or negative.

                    range(start, stop, step)
                        -> start default is 0 (included) (inclusive)
                        -> stop at this value (excluded) (exclusive)
                        -> step is increment (default step is 1)

        -> break : help you exit the loops 

        -> continue : help you skip the current iteration 

        -> pass : acts as a placeholder, does nothing 


    -> Strings 

        -> Strings are one of the most widely used Datatype in any programming language

        -> In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, used to represent text. 
            Strings are a fundamental data type and are widely used for 
            handling and manipulating textual information.

        -> Strings are enclosed in double quotes ("") or single quotes('') or 
            triple quotes(''' ''') or (""" """)

            -> single line strings : use double quotes ("") or single quotes('')

            -> multi line strings : use triple quotes(''' ''') or (""" """)

        -> Rules When Defining Strings 

            -> strings must be defined in  double quotes ("") or single quotes('') or 
            triple quotes(''' ''') or (""" """)

            -> When you use single quote in a string, enclose them in double quotes 
            -> When you use double quote in a string, enclose them in single quotes 
            -> When you use both single quote and double quote in a string, 
                enclose them in triple quotes

    -> Control Statements Tasks 

3rd Nov 2025
=============

    -> Accessing Strings

    -> Indexing 

        -> String indexing in Python allows access to individual characters within a string 
        using their "position", known as the "index". 
        
        -> Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first character is at index 0, 
            the second at index 1, and so on.
        
        -> Positive Indexing:
            Starts from the beginning of the string.
            The index of the first character is 0.
        
        -> Negative Indexing:
            Starts from the end of the string.
            The index of the last character is -1.

        -> text = "python"
            
            0  1  2  3  4  5   [Positive Indexing]
            p  y  t  h  o  n
           -6  -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  [Negative Indexing]

        -> syntax

            string[index]

            -> NOTE : Accessing invalid index will raise error (IndexError)


    -> Slicing 

        -> String slicing in Python is a method for extracting a portion (substring) 
        from a larger string. It utilizes the slice operator [] with specific 
        indices to define the desired segment.

        -> syntax 

            string[start:end:step]

                start (optional): The index where the slice begins (inclusive). If omitted, it defaults to 0 (the beginning of the string).
                end (optional): The index where the slice ends (exclusive). The character at this index is not included. If omitted, it defaults to the length of the string (the end of the string).
                step (optional): The increment between each index during slicing. If omitted, it defaults to 1. A negative step value can be used to slice in reverse.

            -> Earlier range()
                
                range(start,end,step)

    
    -> String Concatenation

    -> Formatted String Literals (f-strings)

        -> Using Interpolation {} with f 

    -> String Repetition 

        -> Repeat strings using "*" operator

    -> String Immutability 

        -> Strings are Immutable in nature (immutable == cannot be changed)

    -> String Methods 

        -> String methods in Python are built-in functions that operate on 
        string objects, allowing for various manipulations, transformations, and checks. 
        It is important to note that strings in Python are immutable, 
        meaning these methods do not modify the original string but 
        instead return a new string with the applied changes.

    -> CRUD Application Continued 

    -> Functional Style Programming

    -> Functions 

        -> In Python, a function is a named, "reuseable block of code"
            designed to perform a specific task.

    -> Why Functions 

        ->  For writing modular, organized and efficient code.

        -> Functions can break down complex problems into smaller and
            simpler manageable sub tasks for promoting code modularity. 

        -> One defined a function can be called multiple times, so that 
            we can achieve code reusability.

    -> Functions are defined using "def" keyword, followed by function name,
        parenthesis(which may contain parameters), and a colon:
        the code within the function is indented 

        -> syntax

            def function_name():
                statements
            
            def function_name(parameters):
                statements
        
        -> calling function is must
                function_name()

14th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Python functions can be defined to accept "parameters" 
        which can act as placeholders for values that will be 
        passed into function when called. 
    
    -> Values passed to the function we call them as "arguments"

    -> We use parameters to make functions dynamic in nature 

    -> Based On arguments passed to functions, we got five types 

        -> Positional Arguments 

        -> Keywords Arguments 

        -> Default Arguments 

        -> Arbitrary Positional Arguments

        -> Arbitrary Keywords Arguments
        

    -> Positional Arguments

        -> In Python, positional arguments are values passed to a function during 
        its call, where the assignment of these values to the function's parameters 
        is determined solely by their order (position) in the argument list. 
        
        -> The first argument in the function call is assigned to the first parameter 
        in the function definition, the second to the second, and so on. 

        -> Order Matters: If the order is incorrect, the function will receive the wrong values 
            for its intended parameters, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.


    -> Keywords Arguments

        -> In Python, keyword arguments are a way to pass values to a function by explicitly 
        "naming the parameters" they correspond to, rather than relying on their position in the argument list. 
        
        -> This offers several advantages, primarily in terms of code readability and flexibility.

    -> Default Arguments

        -> In Python, default arguments allow you to define a function parameter with a "pre-assigned" value. 
        If a caller does not provide an argument for that parameter during a function call, 
        the default value is automatically used. If an argument is provided, it overrides the default.

        -> Placement Requirement: Default arguments must always be placed after any non-default (positional) 
            arguments in the function definition. 
            Attempting to place a non-default argument after a default argument will result in a SyntaxError.
    
    
    -> Arbitrary Positional Arguments

        -> In Python, arbitrary positional arguments allow a function to accept 
            a variable/unknown number of non-keyword arguments. 
            This is achieved by placing an asterisk (*) before a parameter name in the function definition. 
            
        -> This parameter will then collect all the extra positional arguments passed to the function 
            into a single tuple. 

17th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Arbitrary Keyword Arguments

        -> In Python, arbitrary keyword arguments allow a function to accept 
            a variable/unknown number of keyword arguments. 
            This is achieved by placing an asterisk (**) before a parameter name in the function definition. 

        -> This parameter will be collected into a dictionary, where the names will be keys and 
            values will be dictionary values  

    -> "return" keyword 

        -> In Python, the "return" keyword is used within a function to send a value 
        back to the part of the code that called the function.

        -> when you don't use a return, by default a function returns None 

        -> When working with function composition (function calling another function), return will 
            be helpful 

        -> If you use return, make sure it's the last part of statement to be executed

        -> If you have multiple return statements, first will be considered

        -> If multiple returns are present, and used with conditionals, you can control the flow 


18th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Scopes in Functions 

        -> Scope : Inside the code block, where you can access variable depends on Scope

            -> Local Scope

            -> Global Scope 

        -> Local Scope

            -> A local variable declared "inside the function" 
            -> it's lifetime exists only within the function
            -> we cannot use them outside the function 
            -> NOTE : Parameters we are passing to the functions, are also local variables 
        
        -> Global Scope

            -> A Global variable declared outside the function 
            -> it's lifetime exists within the function as well as outside function 

            -> As global variables can be accessed inside the functions, there can be
            name conflicts, in this scenario the preference is given to local variables 

                -> NOTE : To Access Global Variable in above scenario, use globals()

            -> If you want global variables to be changed inside the function, we cannot 
                do that directly 

                -> NOTE : To change Global Variable inside function, use global keyword

    -> Types Of Functions 

        -> Built In Functions 

            -> Pre defined functions, already part of standard python library 

            -> No need to create explicitly again using def keyword 

            -> Examples

                -> type, len, max, min, dir, id, input etc 

        
        -> User Defined Functions 

            -> User defined functions, created by Developers using def keyword

            -> Custom functions created based on customers requirements

            -> Examples

                -> add(), emp_info(), math_ops, bank_transactions() etc 

        
        -> Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions) 

            -> A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function 
            defined with the "lambda" keyword. 

            -> Unlike standard functions defined with def, lambda functions are 
            restricted to a "single expression", which is "implicitly returned".

            -> They are often used for "short, one-time operations" where 
                a full function definition would be unnecessarily verbose.

            -> syntax

                lambda arguments:expression

            -> Using lambda we can write one liner functions called "IILE" 

                Immediately Invoked Lambda Expression  

19th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Lambda & Higher Order Functions 

    -> Generally lambda functions will be attached with Higher Order Functions 

    -> Higher Order Functions 

        -> The goal of Higher Order Functions is to "perform operations on Iterables" 

        -> Concise Code, without writing lengthy code with loops 
    
            -> map()

                -> The map() function in Python is a built-in function that applies 
                    a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string) 
                    and returns an iterator containing the results. 
                    
                -> It provides a concise way to perform "transformations" on 
                    collections of data without explicitly writing loops. 

                    -> syntax

                        map(function, iterable)

                -> NOTE: Just Like Using For Loop with function


20th Nov 2025
=============

    -> filter()

                -> The filter() function in Python is a built-in function used to construct an iterator 
                from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. 
                It is a powerful tool for selectively extracting data based on a given condition.

                -> syntax

                        filter(function, iterable)

                -> NOTE: Just Like Using For Loop with Conditions 

    
    -> reduce()

                -> The reduce() function in Python, found within the "functools" module, is a higher-order function 
                that applies a given function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, 
                reducing the iterable to a single, cumulative value.

                -> from functools import reduce

                -> syntax

                        reduce(function, iterable)
    
    -> etc

            functions approach 

26th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Modules

        -> A module is simple python file which contains python definitions 

            -> variables 
            -> functions 
            -> classes 
            -> etc 
        
        -> Modules Allow you to reuse code, instead of rewriting 

        -> NOTE: Reusability in terms of code blocks go for functions 

        -> NOTE: Reusability in terms of files go for modules 
    
    -> Types Of Modules

        -> Inbuilt Modules 

            -> Provided as part of standard python library 

        -> User Defined Modules

            -> Created By User 

            -> import using file name 
        
        -> External Modules 

            -> Provided by 3rd party vendors 

                -> https://pypi.org

            -> pip (python package manager)

                -> pip install module_name(win)
                
                -> pip3 install module_name(mac)
    
    -> syntax 

        -> import module (import complete modules meaning loading all functionalities)

        -> from module import specific_functionality (recommended)

28th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Reusability

        -> Block Of Code - functions (call with function_name)

        -> A File Of Code - modules (call with file_name)

        -> A Folder of Code - packages (call with folder_name)

    -> Package 

        -> A folder with multiple "modules" (multiple python files)

        -> A package contains a special file named as __init__.py 

            -> __init__.py, it can be blank, but generally we keep start up 
                initial data or start up configurations 
            
            -> In order to use package, use name of the folder

    
    -> File Management With Python

        -> All the activities we performed so far, were dealing with
            Non-Persistent Storage (RAM / MEMORY)

                -> Non-Persistent Storage is "Temporary" 

        -> Now the Requirement is to work with Persistent Storage (HARD DISK) 

                -> Persistent Storage is "Permanent" 

    
    -> File Operations 

        -> CRUD 

            -> Create File 
            -> Read File 
            -> Update File 
            -> Delete File 

    -> To Work with any type of file, python has provided 

        -> open() function 

            -> Modes 

                -> r - read 
                -> w - write (overwrite data)
                -> a - append (preserve old data and then add new data)
                -> etc 
        
        -> syntax - 1

            open("file_path","mode"):
                statements 
            
            open("file.txt","r"):
                statements 

            -> NOTE: Here we need to explicitly close files after 
                operations are performed 
        
        -> syntax - 2 (recommended way)

            with open("file_path","mode") as alias_name:
                statements 
            
            open("file.txt","r") as file_data:
                statements 
            
            -> NOTE: Here implicitly files are closed, 
                after operations are performed 

29th Nov 2025
=============

    -> File Reading "r" mode

            -> read()
            -> readline()
            -> readlines() 

        -> File Writing "w" mode

            -> write 
            -> writelines 

            -> NOTE: in "w" mode, previous data is overwritten 

        -> File Writing "a" mode [ Append Mode ]

            -> NOTE: in "a" mode, previous data is not overwritten 


2nd Dec 2025
=============

    -> Folder / Directory Management 

        -> "os" module 
        -> "shutil" module 

    -> Create Folders & Delete Folders can be done with above modules 

    -> Working with "csv" files 

        -> Very commonly used in Data Oriented Applications 

    -> For fixed data sets, we can use reader functionality from csv module 

    -> For changing data sets, we can use DictReader functionality from csv module 


3rd Dec 2025
=============

    -> reader 

    -> DictReader

    -> writer 

        -> writerow - one row

        -> writerows - multiple rows 

    -> DictWriter 

        -> writerow - one row

        -> writerows - multiple rows 

4th Dec 2025
=============

    -> Working with JSON Files

    -> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a human-readable, text-based format 
    for "storing" and "exchanging" data that is widely used for 
    web applications, APIs, and configuration files. 

    -> JSON represents data as key-value pairs within objects 
        (enclosed in curly braces {}) -> same as Dictionary in python 

            -> https://docs.tomorrow.io/reference/weather-forecast
    
    -> Very Commonly Used in Application Development (API's)

    -> We have "json" module built in python standard library 

    -> json operations

        -> dump -> as a file we can store data accepts data and filename

        -> load -> from a json file we can read data 

        -> dumps -> object based writing 

        -> loads -> object based reading

    -> Student Management System - With File Storage On Disk 

8th Dec 2025
=============

    -> Exception Handling 

        -> Exception : It's an "Error", which might occur during the program execution 

        -> By default when python encounters an Error, it abruptly "STOPS" the program execution

        -> To change the above default behavior, and handle the Exceptions 
            by yourself, we need following

            -> try: used to keep the code, that will cause error 

            -> except: used to keep the code that should run, when error occurs 

                -> NOTE: Try statement must have at least one except or finally clause
            
            -> else: used to keep the code that should run, if no Exceptions were raised in try block

            -> finally: used to keep the code that should run wether an Exception raised or not 
                       : DB / File Streams -> closing connections will be in finally block

9th Dec 2025
=============

    -> Earlier we worked with In built Exceptions provided as part of 
        python standard library (ZeroDivisionError, IndexError, ValueError etc)

        -> https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html 

        -> print(help(Exception))

    -> But sometimes you need your "own custom error" that describes a situation 
        specific to your program

    -> You create a custom exception by "defining a class" that inherits 
        from Python’s built-in "Exception" class. 
        This concept is connected to inheritance.

        -> syntax

            class MyCustomError(Exception):
                pass 

    -> OOP - Object Oriented Programming

        -> OOP, or Object-Oriented Programming, is a programming model 
        that organizes code around "objects" which are software entities 
        that contain both data (attributes/variables) and the methods(functions) 
        that operate on that data. 

        -> Instead of a sequence of functions, OOP focuses on objects interacting 
            with one another, making code more modular, reusable and easier to maintain.

        -> Earlier 

            -> Writing Long List Of Instruction (task oriented)
        
        -> Moving Forward 

            -> Thinking in terms of real world entities (objects)

                -> Object - Data (attributes/variables)

                -> Object - Behavior (methods/functions)

            -> Writing code that follows Object Oriented Design 

                -> Focus is on objects and their relationships, not just functions 

                -> We don't think about steps, we think about "who does what"

        -> Four Pillars Of OOP 

            -> Inheritance 

                -> Using Inheritance We Get "Reusability"

            -> Encapsulation 

                -> Binding Data & Behavior Together 

            -> Abstraction

                -> Hiding Complexity, and show only what user needs 

            -> Polymorphism

                -> Extensibility, One Entity has multiple forms 
    
    Compare Functional vs OOP 

                            Functional Style                        Object Oriented Style 

    -> Focus                Step by step functions                  Real World Objects 

    -> Data & Function      Separate                                Combined inside a class 

    -> Code Organization    One Big Script                          Multiple Reuseable Classes 

    -> Reusability          Harder                                  Easy as for Inheritance

    -> Maintenance          Complex as code grows                   More Cleaner 


    -> Functional Style Code 

        def student_attended_session(name):
            print(f"{name} Attended Session")

    
    -> Object Oriented Style Code 

        class Student:

            def __init__(self,name):
                self.name = name
            
            def attended_session(self):
                print(f"{self.name} Attended Session")

    
    -> To Work With Object Oriented Programming, below is the approach 

        -> Classes 

        -> Objects

        -> Methods 

        -> Constructors (__init__)

        -> Instance Members 

        -> Class Members 

        -> Static Members 

        -> OOP Principals

            -> Inheritance 
            -> Encapsulation
            -> Abstraction
            -> Polymorphism
