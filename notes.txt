=============    

    -> Python rules 

        -> Comments are represented using # 

            -> when we comment using #, python will ignore that line

        -> When working with numerics (1,2,3.5 etc) we can directly use them in print()

        -> When working with text, in python text is called as "strings"

            -> Rule is strings need to be enclosed in 'good morning' or "good morning"

        -> print() : prints on standard output 

        -> id() : will show memory address 

    -> Memory Model Of Python (Variables)

        -> If the value is already present, python will not create again a memory block, 
            instead it will just use reference, so memory is efficiently used 

        -> Simple Data Type : Holds one value in a single variable ex is int  

        -> Complex Data Type : Holds "multiple values" in a single variable ex is list 

    -> type() : will display the data type of variable

    -> Interpolation 

        -> Interpolation technique replaces, place holders with actual values dynamically

        -> Using f-strings (Formatted String Literals)

                    -> x = 10 
                    -> x = x + 5 (long form)
                    -> x += 5 (short form)
                    -> x *= 5 (short form)

                    -> Increment / Decrement : ++ / --

                        -> Python doesn't support above syntax 

                        -> In python to achieve Increment / Decrement we use

                    -> and : if both the conditions are True, then result is True 
                    -> or : if one of the conditions is True, then result is True 
                    -> not : negates, if true then false and vice versa

                            X       Y       X and Y    X or Y    not X    not Y

        -> Numeric Type 

            -> int : 1,2,4,0,-1,-5 etc
            -> float : 3.5, 10.0, 2.1 etc 
            -> complex : 
                -> a + ib in math (i is imaginary)
                -> a + bj in python 

        -> Text Type 

            -> str : String is a sequence of characters inclosed in " " or ' '

        -> Boolean Type

            -> bool : Represents True/False 
        
        -> None Type 

            -> NoneType : Represents nothing i.e absence of value 

        -> Sequence Type 

            -> String is also a sequence type 

            -> List : Complex Datatype => Holds Multiple Values, represented using [], Mutable (can be changed)

            -> Tuple : Complex Datatype => Holds Multiple Values, represented using (), Immutable (cannot be changed)

        -> Type Casting is NOT SAFE, data loss might occur 

        -> We use some predefined Functions 

27th Oct 2025
=============

    -> Control Structures / Control Statements

        -> Control structures helps you determine the flow of execution in a program, 
            allowing you to make decisions and repeat tasks.

        -> Python has given three types of Control structures

            -> Conditional Statements / Structures (Decision Making Statements)

            -> Looping Statements / Structures (Iteration Statements)

            -> Branching Statements / Structures (Jumping Statements)

        -> Indentation 

            -> Indentation in Python is a fundamental and mandatory aspect of its "syntax", 
                used to define the structure and hierarchy of code blocks. 
                Unlike many other programming languages that use curly braces or keywords 
                to delineate blocks, Python relies entirely on consistent indentation.

            -> Using space correctly 

                -> Python allows for any consistent number of spaces or a single tab(4 spaces) for indentation, 
                the widely accepted and recommended standard.

                -> At least one space but recommended is 4 space i.e tab 

                
        -> Conditional statements

            -> Used to run a "block of code" based on a condition result

                    -> syntax 
                        if condition:
                            statements 

            
            -> if else

                -> runs a block of code, if the condition is True 
                   runs another block of code, if the condition is False  

                    -> syntax 
                        if condition:
                            statements 
                        else:
                            statements
                        
        -> NOTE : input() function reads input from user 

28th Oct 2025
=============
    
    -> The ternary operator in Python, also known as a conditional expression, 
    provides a concise way to write an if-else statement on a single line. 
    It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values 
    based on whether the condition is true or false.

    -> syntax 
        value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
    
    -> elif ladder

        -> elif is a keyword that stands for "else if". 
        It is used in conditional statements to check for "multiple conditions" 
        sequentially after an initial if statement.

        -> syntax 
            if condition:

        -> Offers a more expressive and readable alternative to 
            complex if-elif-else chains

        -> introduced from python 3.X

=============

    -> Looping Statements (Iteration Statements)

        -> Loops in Python are used to repeatedly execute a block of code. 
        
        -> When you want to do a task multiple times, use loops

        -> Python offers two primary types of loops
            
            -> "while" loops 

            -> "for" loops

        -> while loop 

            -> while loops execute a block of code repeatedly 
            as long as a specified condition remains True

            -> We use while generally, when we don't know number of
            Iterations in advance 

            -> syntax

                while condition:
                    statements
                
        -> for loop

            -> for loops are used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) 
            or other iterable objects. 
            The loop executes a block of code once for each item in the sequence. 

            -> We use for generally, when we  know number of Iterations in advance 

            -> syntax 

                for var in sequence:
                    print(var)
            
            -> How do i know, if an object is iterable ?

                -> use dir() 
                -> dir() function in Python is a built-in function used for introspection, 
                    allowing you to discover the attributes and methods of an object 

            -> range() 

                -> The range() function in Python generates an immutable sequence of numbers. 
                It is commonly used for iterating a specific number of times in for loops. 

                -> range(start, stop, step): This form generates a sequence of numbers starting 
                from start (inclusive) up to, but not including, the stop value, 
                with an increment of step. The step can be positive or negative.

                    range(start, stop, step)
                        -> start default is 0 (included) (inclusive)
                        -> stop at this value (excluded) (exclusive)
                        -> step is increment (default step is 1)

    -> Branching Statements (Jumping Statements)

        -> break : help you exit the loops 

        -> continue : help you skip the current iteration 

        -> pass : acts as a placeholder, does nothing 


    -> Strings 

        -> Strings are one of the most widely used Datatype in any programming language

        -> In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, used to represent text. 
            Strings are a fundamental data type and are widely used for 
            handling and manipulating textual information.

        -> Strings are enclosed in double quotes ("") or single quotes('') or 
            triple quotes(''' ''') or (""" """)

            -> single line strings : use double quotes ("") or single quotes('')

            -> multi line strings : use triple quotes(''' ''') or (""" """)

        -> Rules When Defining Strings 

            -> strings must be defined in  double quotes ("") or single quotes('') or 
            triple quotes(''' ''') or (""" """)

            -> When you use single quote in a string, enclose them in double quotes 
            -> When you use double quote in a string, enclose them in single quotes 
            -> When you use both single quote and double quote in a string, 
                enclose them in triple quotes

3rd Nov 2025
=============

    -> Accessing Strings

    -> Indexing 

        -> String indexing in Python allows access to individual characters within a string 
        using their "position", known as the "index". 
        
        -> Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first character is at index 0, 
            the second at index 1, and so on.
        
        -> Positive Indexing:
            Starts from the beginning of the string.
            The index of the first character is 0.
        
        -> Negative Indexing:
            Starts from the end of the string.
            The index of the last character is -1.

        -> text = "python"
            
            0  1  2  3  4  5   [Positive Indexing]
            p  y  t  h  o  n
           -6  -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  [Negative Indexing]

        -> syntax

            string[index]

            -> NOTE : Accessing invalid index will raise error (IndexError)


    -> Slicing 

        -> String slicing in Python is a method for extracting a portion (substring) 
        from a larger string. It utilizes the slice operator [] with specific 
        indices to define the desired segment.

        -> syntax 

            string[start:end:step]

                start (optional): The index where the slice begins (inclusive). If omitted, it defaults to 0 (the beginning of the string).
                end (optional): The index where the slice ends (exclusive). The character at this index is not included. If omitted, it defaults to the length of the string (the end of the string).
                step (optional): The increment between each index during slicing. If omitted, it defaults to 1. A negative step value can be used to slice in reverse.

            -> Earlier range()
                
                range(start,end,step)

    -> Formatted String Literals (f-strings)

        -> Using Interpolation {} with f 

    -> String Repetition 

        -> Repeat strings using "*" operator

    -> String Immutability 

        -> Strings are Immutable in nature (immutable == cannot be changed)

    -> String Methods 

        -> String methods in Python are built-in functions that operate on 
        string objects, allowing for various manipulations, transformations, and checks. 
        It is important to note that strings in Python are immutable, 
        meaning these methods do not modify the original string but 
        instead return a new string with the applied changes.
